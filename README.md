## Lord of the Test: A Minetest subgame.
### Version: 1.1.0

**NOTE: THIS IS THE BIOMES BRANCH.**

**This branch will have force pushes, and rebases, in order to keep it up to date with master**

**The main purpose of this branch is to provide a base for comments on my work of adding new biomes, and ultimately for the addition of an "in-place" mapgen, that is, a mapgen which puts the biomes in the correct places!**

**Use at your own risk! Expect many breakages and ugly borders between biomes!**

This is a game for Minetest that adds [Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) elements into the game.
